"""Who is "one visitor" for rate limiting.

Behind Vercel's proxy, REMOTE_ADDR identifies the platform, not the
visitor — every request could share one budget. Vercel instead puts the
client's public IP in X-Real-IP (identical to X-Forwarded-For), overwriting
any value the client sent, "to prevent IP spoofing"
(https://vercel.com/docs/headers/request-headers).

That guarantee only holds on Vercel. Anywhere else a client can set the
header to anything, so it's ignored and REMOTE_ADDR is used instead.
